# Setting up The Document ------------------------------------------

```{r}
# loading in the packages necessary
library(nflverse)
library(nflreadr)
library(nflplotR)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(dplyr)
library(gganimate)
library(ggfootball)
library(readr)
library(glmnet)
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
# reading in necessary data
wr_plays <- read.csv("wr_model_data.csv")

wr_plays_for_model <- wr_plays |> 
  filter(down == 1, yardsToGo == 10)
```

# Splitting the data for the model ------------------------------

## Splitting to testing and training data
```{r}
set.seed(12345)
wr_plays_split <- initial_split(wr_plays_for_model, prop = 0.8)

wr_plays_train <- training(wr_plays_split)

wr_plays_test <- testing(wr_plays_split)
```

## Come back and do bootstrapping

# Building the model For 1st & 10 situations -------------------------

```{r}
logit_model <- multinom_reg(mode = "classification",
                            engine = "nnet")



model_recipe <- recipe(routeRan ~ nflId + inMotionAtBallSnap + shiftSinceLineset + MotionSinceLineset + quarter + gameClock + offenseFormation + )
```
