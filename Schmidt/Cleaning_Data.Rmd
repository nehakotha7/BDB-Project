# Identifying which players are included in the receiver alignment  --------------------

## Setting up the data to determine which players are included in the receiver alignment 

### Adding official position as a variable
```{r}
official_position <- players |> 
  select(nflId, position) |> 
  rename(official_position = position)

tracking_week1 <- inner_join(tracking_week1, official_position)

tracking_week2 <- inner_join(tracking_week2, official_position)

tracking_week3 <- inner_join(tracking_week3, official_position)

tracking_week4 <- inner_join(tracking_week4, official_position)

tracking_week5 <- inner_join(tracking_week5, official_position)

tracking_week6 <- inner_join(tracking_week6, official_position)

tracking_week7 <- inner_join(tracking_week7, official_position)

tracking_week8 <- inner_join(tracking_week8, official_position)

tracking_week9 <- inner_join(tracking_week9, official_position)
```

### Adding variables indicating how many receivers lined up on the each side of the line, how many total receivers, and how far the line of scrimmage is from the end zone they are trying to score in 
```{r}
# add the absolute yard line (ranging 0 to 100),  number of receivers, and number of receivers on the left and right side variables to the tracking data (created receiver variables)
important_variables <- plays |> 
  mutate(num_receivers_one_side = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(receiverAlignment, "\\d{1}")),
         num_receivers_other_side = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(receiverAlignment, "(?<=x)[0-9]+")),
         total_receivers_in_alignment = num_receivers_one_side + num_receivers_other_side,
         yardsTillTouchdown = ifelse(possessionTeam != yardlineSide, yardlineNumber, 100 - yardlineNumber),  # makes it so the yard line variable is how far they are from their the end zone they are scoring in 
         yardsTillTouchdown = ifelse(yardlineNumber == 50, 50, yardsTillTouchdown),
         absoluteYardlineNumber = absoluteYardlineNumber - 10) |> 
  select(gameId, playId, yardsTillTouchdown, total_receivers_in_alignment, num_receivers_one_side, num_receivers_other_side, preSnapHomeScore, preSnapVisitorScore)

tracking_week1 <- inner_join(tracking_week1, important_variables)

tracking_week2 <- inner_join(tracking_week2, important_variables)

tracking_week3 <- inner_join(tracking_week3, important_variables)

tracking_week7 <- inner_join(tracking_week7, important_variables)

tracking_week8 <- inner_join(tracking_week8, important_variables)

tracking_week9 <- inner_join(tracking_week9, important_variables)

```


### Creating a variable that indicates how far the players are from the end zone they are trying to score in (rounded and not) 
```{r}

adding_player_x_position <- function(week_num){
  week_num |> 
  mutate(yardlines_to_go = ifelse(playDirection == "left", round(x - 10), NA),
         exact_yards_to_go = ifelse(playDirection == "left", x - 10, NA),
         yardlines_to_go = ifelse(playDirection == "right", 100 - round(x - 10), yardlines_to_go), 
         exact_yards_to_go = ifelse(playDirection == "right", 100 - (x - 10), exact_yards_to_go),
         yardlines_to_go = ifelse(frameType == "SNAP" & (yardsTillTouchdown > yardlines_to_go), yardsTillTouchdown, yardlines_to_go))  # all of these were off by less than a yard
}

tracking_week1 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week1)

tracking_week2 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week2)

tracking_week3 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week3)

tracking_week4 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week4)

tracking_week5 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week5)

tracking_week6 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week6)

tracking_week7 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week7)

tracking_week8 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week8)

tracking_week9 <- adding_player_x_position(tracking_week9)
```

### Indicating which player number they are (1 means furthest left and 11 means furthest right - in terms of direction they are facing)
```{r}
player_numbers <- function(week_num){
  week_num |> 
    group_by(gameId, playId, frameId) |> 
    arrange(gameId, playId, frameId, y) |>
    mutate(player_number = ifelse(playDirection == "right", 12 - row_number(), row_number())) |> 
    ungroup() |> 
    select(gameId, playId, nflId, frameId, player_number)
  }
 
tracking_week1 <- inner_join(tracking_week1, player_numbers(tracking_week1))

tracking_week2 <- inner_join(tracking_week2, player_numbers(tracking_week2))

tracking_week3 <- inner_join(tracking_week3, player_numbers(tracking_week3))

tracking_week4 <- inner_join(tracking_week4, player_numbers(tracking_week4))

tracking_week6 <- inner_join(tracking_week6, player_numbers(tracking_week6))

tracking_week7 <- inner_join(tracking_week7, player_numbers(tracking_week7))

tracking_week8 <- inner_join(tracking_week8, player_numbers(tracking_week8))

tracking_week9 <- inner_join(tracking_week9, player_numbers(tracking_week9))
```

# IMPORTANT NOTE: This is assuming that the running back in the backfield is NOT included in the receiver alignment

### Initially trying to determine if player is in left or right alignment
```{r}

    select(gameId, playId, nflId, receiver_in_left_alignment, receiver_in_right_alignment)

# Adding Variables ------------------------

## Adding Score Differential 

```{r}

  mutate(score_differential = ifelse(club == homeTeamAbbr, preSnapHomeScore - preSnapVisitorScore, preSnapVisitorScore - preSnapHomeScore)) |> 
  select(-homeTeamAbbr, -preSnapHomeScore, -preSnapVisitorScore)
```

## Addding a variable `moved` indicating if they moved after their line was set

```{r}
finished_plays <- finished_plays |> 
  mutate(moved = ifelse(shiftSinceLineset == TRUE | inMotionAtBallSnap == TRUE | motionSinceLineset == TRUE, TRUE, FALSE),
         moved = ifelse(is.na(moved), FALSE, TRUE)) 
```

## Adding a variable `num_players_moved` indicating how many players moved on the play

```{r}
num_players_moved <- finished_plays |> 
  filter(moved == TRUE,
         frameType == "SNAP") |>

num_players_moved <- rbind(num_players_moved, no_movement)

finished_plays <- finished_plays |>

## Adding variables


### Adding distance from line of scrimmage variable 
```{r}
finished_plays <- finished_plays |>

  mutate(dist_from_line_of_scrimmage = abs(yardsTillTouchdown - yardlines_to_go))

### Adding receiver alignment number
```{r}

  group_by(gameId, playId) |>

## Replacing NAs for routeRan

### If run or pass option then if the receiver did not run a route routeRan = NO ROUTE

  mutate(routeRan = ifelse(receiver_in_alignment == TRUE & pff_runPassOption == 1 & is.na(routeRan), "NO ROUTE", routeRan)) 

```

### If the play was a hand off or run play and not pff_runPassOption then routeRan = RUN BLOCK

```{r}
finished_plays <- finished_plays |> 
  mutate(routeRan = ifelse((event == "handoff" | event == "run") & pff_runPassOption == 0 & is.na(routeRan), "RUN BLOCK", routeRan))
```

### If it is a pass play and did not run route then NO ROUTE
```{r}
finished_plays |> 
  filter(receiver_in_alignment == TRUE,

finished_plays <- inner_join(finished_plays, pass_plays)

finished_plays <- finished_plays |> 
  mutate(routeRan = ifelse(pass == TRUE & is.na(routeRan), "NO ROUTE", routeRan))

## Adding Variables for number of receivers left for each play

  mutate(num_receivers_left = 0)

left_players <- rbind(left_players, no_left_players)

finished_plays <- inner_join(finished_plays, left_players)
```

## Adding Variables for number of receivers right for each play
```{r}
right_players <- finished_plays |>
  filter(frameType == "SNAP",
         receiver_in_right_alignment == TRUE) |>
